Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

## Description
Created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the Day.jsLinks to an external site. library to work with date and time.
